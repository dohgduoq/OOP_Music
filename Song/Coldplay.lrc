[00:13.16]I used to rule the world
[00:16.85]Seas would rise when I gave the word
[00:19.53]Now in the morning, I sleep alone
[00:23.95]Sweep the streets I used to own
[00:29.02]
[00:40.64]I used to roll the dice
[00:44.70]Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
[00:47.96]Listened as the crowd would sing
[00:51.77]"Now the old king is dead, long live the king"
[00:54.81]One minute I held the key
[00:58.68]Next, the walls were closed on me
[01:01.45]And I discovered that my castles stand
[01:05.51]Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
[01:09.43]I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
[01:13.21]Roman cavalry choirs are singing
[01:16.67]Be my mirror, my sword and shield
[01:20.19]My missionaries in a foreign field
[01:23.59]For some reason, I can't explain
[01:27.19]Once you'd gone, there was never
[01:29.82]Never an honest word
[01:33.63]And that was when I ruled the world
[01:38.52]
[01:49.98]It was a wicked and wild wind
[01:54.25]Blew down the doors to let me in
[01:57.24]Shattered windows and the sound of drums
[02:01.40]People couldn't believe what I'd become
[02:04.79]Revolutionaries wait
[02:08.43]For my head on a silver plate
[02:11.28]Just a puppet on a lonely string
[02:15.45]Oh, who would ever want to be king?
[02:19.12]I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
[02:22.92]Roman cavalry choirs are singing
[02:26.23]Be my mirror, my sword and shield
[02:29.69]My missionaries in a foreign field
[02:33.27]For some reason, I can't explain
[02:36.55]I know Saint Peter won't call my name
[02:39.84]Never an honest word
[02:42.91]But that was when I ruled the world
[02:47.28]
[03:15.15]Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
[03:18.40]Roman cavalry choirs are singing
[03:22.08]Be my mirror, my sword and shield
[03:25.36]My missionaries in a foreign field
[03:28.98]For some reason, I can't explain
[03:32.44]I know Saint Peter won't call my name
[03:35.58]Never an honest word
[03:38.72]But that was when I ruled the world
[03:41.27]
