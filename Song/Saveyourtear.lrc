[00:02.19] Ooh
[00:05.27] Na-na, yeah
[00:08.66] I saw you dancing in a crowded room (uh)
[00:12.78] You look so happy when I'm not with you
[00:16.14] But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
[00:20.22] A single teardrop falling from your eye
[00:24.73] I don't know why I run away
[00:30.44]
[00:32.89] I make you cry when I run away
[00:40.58] You could've asked me why I broke your heart
[00:44.85] You could've told me that you fell apart
[00:48.97] But you walked past me like I wasn't there
[00:53.06] And just pretended like you didn't care
[00:57.54] I don't know why I run away
[01:03.26]
[01:05.41] I make you cry when I run away
[01:11.64]
[01:13.77] Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
[01:17.81] Save your tears for another
[01:20.97] Save your tears for another day
[01:29.14] Save your tears for another day (so)
[01:37.78] I made you think that I would always stay
[01:42.12] I said some things that I should never say
[01:46.15] Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
[01:50.32] And now you won't love me for a second time
[01:54.72] I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
[02:02.37] Said, I make you cry when I run away
[02:10.37] Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
[02:14.65] Save your tears for another
[02:18.61] I realize that I'm much too late
[02:22.78] And you deserve someone better
[02:26.02] Save your tears for another day (oh yeah)
[02:34.19] Save your tears for another day (yeah)
[02:43.43] I don't know why I run away
[02:49.62]
[02:51.62] I'll make you cry when I run away
[02:58.58] Save your tears for another day
[03:04.30] Ooh, girl, I said (ah)
[03:06.70] Save your tears for another day (ah)
[03:14.61] Save your tears for another day (ah)
[03:22.82] Save your tears for another day (ah)
[03:29.12]
